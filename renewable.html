    <h2>Renewable Power Sources</h2>
    <ul class="a">
        <li> Solar Energy</li>
        <p>Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.</p>

    <ul class="a">
        <li>Wind Energy</li>
        <p>Once called windmills, the technology used to harness the power of wind has advanced significantly over the past ten years, with the United States increasing its wind power capacity 30% year over year. Wind turbines, as they are now called, collect and convert the kinetic energy that wind produces into electricity to help power the grid.</p>
        <p>Wind energy is actually a byproduct of the sun. The sun’s uneven heating of the atmosphere, the earth’s irregular surfaces (mountains and valleys), and the planet's revolution around the sun all combine to create wind. Since wind is in plentiful supply, it’s a sustainable resource for as long as the sun’s rays heat the planet.</p>

        <li>Hydropower</li>
        <p>Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is one of the oldest and largest sources of renewable energy, which uses the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity. </p>
        <p>The benefits of hydropower have been recognized and harnessed for thousands of years. In addition to being a renewable and cost-effective form of energy, hydropower plants can provide power to the grid immediately, serving as a flexible and reliable form of backup power during major electricity outages or disruptions. Hydropower also produces a number of benefits outside of electricity generation, such as flood control, irrigation support, and water supply.</p>

    <ul class="a">
        <li>Geothermal energy</li>
        <p>Geothermal energy is heat energy from the earth—geo (earth) + thermal (heat).</p>
        <p>Geothermal resources are reservoirs of hot water that exist or are human-made at varying temperatures and depths below the earth's surface. Wells ranging from a few feet to several miles deep can be drilled into underground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that can be brought to the surface for use in a variety of applications, including electricity generation, heating and cooling and direct use</p>
